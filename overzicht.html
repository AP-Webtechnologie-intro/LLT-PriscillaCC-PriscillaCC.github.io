      <h5>Title description, Jan 1, 2024</h5>
      <img src="Afbeeldingen/doves-wreath.png" alt="Hoop" class="d-block" style="width:100%">
      <p>In Christianity, hope is a key theological virtue, along with faith and charity (love). It is distinct from faith and charity because it is directed exclusively toward the future as a fervent desire and confident expectation.
        The dictionary definition of hope is a feeling of expectation, a desire or wish for a certain thing to happen. However, the biblical definition of hope takes it one step further. Hope in the Bible is an expectation with certainty that God will do what he has said.
        This hope is not something we can achieve but what we can receive. It is a provision of God, not from us or anyone else. No matter how good we live our lives, no matter how many religious things we do, and no matter how well we prepare for the rest of our lives, our <em>"Hope"</em> is given to us by God.
        Christians believe that hope is a crucial part of their faith. Without hope, they believe people would be lost. Hope is what keeps people going when things get tough, and it helps them believe that there is a better future.
        In essence, you have hope because you have faith, and you have faith because you have hope. However, what matters most is the object of your faith and hope, that makes all the difference. The hope that Christians have is set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.</p>

      <h5>Christmas is here!, Dec 25, 2023</h5>
      <img src="Afbeeldingen/achtergrond-kersttak-goud.jpg" alt="Feestelijk" class="d-block" style="width:100%">
      <p>Christmas is a Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. It is observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world1. The English term Christmas (“mass on Christ's day”) is of fairly recent origin.
        The traditional Christmas narrative, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies1. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word.
        In the early 20th century, Christmas also became a secular family holiday, observed by Christians and non-Christians alike. The secular holiday is often devoid of Christian elements, with the mythical figure Santa Claus playing the pivotal role.
        For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity rather than knowing Jesus's exact birth date is considered to be the primary purpose of celebrating Christmas.</p>

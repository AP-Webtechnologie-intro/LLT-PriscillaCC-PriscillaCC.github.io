      <h6><em>The Inspiring Beauty of English Christian Songs</em></h6>
      <br>
       <p>English Christian songs are often appreciated for their beautiful lyrics. These lyrics can contain deep spiritual messages, express feelings of love and worship, and inspire and comfort the listener.
        An example is the song “What a Beautiful Name” by Hillsong Worship. The lyrics of this song speak about the beauty and power of the name of Jesus, and how nothing can compare to it. The song also describes the love of Jesus, which was so great that he left heaven to be with us1.
        Another beautiful song is “You're Beautiful” which says that you are treasured, sacred, and His.
        These songs and many others provide a way for believers to express their faith and love for God, and can be a source of comfort and inspiration. Each song is unique and has its own special message, and that's what makes English Christian songs so beautiful.</p>

        Hey, I got the juice

        Real talk to rebel to rehab
        We been had it, don't mind that rehash
        I'm teaching the youth
        'Member we was always seeking his face
        Running up the charts was never the race
        Buy a ticket to the show and you might get to heaven on it
        Boy, we leaking, my grace dripping
        Don't pull fours with the full state, tipping
        Me and Wande 'bout the Lone Star flipping
        Man, the First Lady got our first lady on her playlist
        I'm tripping, we too blessed, hand of the Lord on the set
        See what He finna do next
        Shawty hit me on my jack and said, "Jump on the track!"
        I said, "Run it up, I'm feeling blessed"
      </p>

      <p>

        Hold me down, I'ma grow (yeah)
        You should peep who your woes
        You exposed (ayy), you a clone, that's appearance
        Now your worth looking real low like a clearance
        Got you giving up, whoa, where the perseverance?
        Gotta stick to it even with the interference
        Gotta stay prayed up
        Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout the spirit
        Ooh yeah, ayy
        That's what's up now, uh (yeah)

        Yeah, I've been down, no bluff now, uh (yeah)
        Yeah, I've been down, but I'm up now, uh
        So pull up with the test
        Won't flunk now
        I ain't gotta stress, nah
        I ain't gotta fuss now (yeah)
        I just gotta go and live my best
        "You know what" now, uh

        (Mike Todd)
        Now, let me tell y'all about really living blessed up (blessed up)
        See, I've been at the lowest of lows
        And I've been at the highest mountain tops
        And the one thing that I found out is
        It's not about the platform
        It's not about the net worth
        It's not about the paper chasing
        But it's all about the purpose chasing
        You see, what you've gone through has made you
        And it's actually the reason why you blessed (blessed up)
        So go on and turn up the music
        And don't stress, 'cause the season you're in right now
        Just give it a little time
        And it'll prove you blessed (Mike Todd!)
      </p>
      <p>Blessed up</p>
